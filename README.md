# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses a Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. I found this project to be fun, challenging, and offered me many chances to learn and grown my skills. 

To make this project work properly, one has to know GET and POST requests, chaining of requests, and have an understanding of client-side and server-side code. The moving parts of this project include getting input from the user and storing it. Using the user's inputted Zipcode to make a WEB API call to grab weather data related to that zip code. Successfully sift through all the data that the API returns in order to access just the Temp data. Then, put together a a JavaScript Object that combines the User's inputted data and data from the Web API then updates the webpage to display that information to the user. 

## Instructions
Two specific files required modifying, the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file. You can see `index.html` for element references, and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use `style.css` to style your application to customized perfection.

Running this project requires Node.js along with dependencies such as Express, Body-Parser, and CORS. 

## Extras
If you are interested in testing your code as you go, you can use `tests.js` as a template for writing and running some basic tests for your code.
